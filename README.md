# Responsive Landing Page

Code-along repo for [How to Create a Website - Complete workflow](https://youtu.be/aEUkm1as3KE) by Kevin Powell.

## Changes

- Uses `.scss` instead of `.sass` file
- Uses VSCode's `Live Sass` extension

## Memo

- Issue: [Always receiving "Extension host terminated unexpectedly](https://github.com/ritwickdey/vscode-live-sass-compiler/issues/112)
  - solution: `"color-highlight.languages": [ "*", "!scss" ]`
